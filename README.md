Hi my name is Thomas Gilman. I am a Software Engineer that Graduated from Shawnee State University with a Bachelors Degree in Digital Simulation and Game Engineering, as well as Computer Engineering Technologies. I am passionate about STEM and creating which is the reason why I chose Software Engineering as my career. I will continue to create and develop my skills to better my self in the pursuit of knowledge and bettering the world around me. While I am agile in learning and developing in new languages and skills, C++ is my favorite language. I also hope to pursue a career in Software Simulation Engineering.
